# Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Overview
This project introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. You'll learn how to write JavaScript code that interacts with HTML elements, responds to user events, and dynamically updates the webpage content.

## Objectives
- Write basic JavaScript functions
- Manipulate the DOM dynamically
- Respond to user interactions
- Understand event handling in JavaScript
- Apply CSS styling through JavaScript

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- A modern web browser with developer tools (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## Project Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create the following files in your project directory:
   - `index.html` - Main HTML document
   - `style.css` - CSS stylesheet
   - `script.js` - JavaScript code

## Instructions

### HTML Structure
- Create a well-structured HTML5 document
- Include proper DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags
- Link your CSS and JavaScript files properly
- Use at least 5 different HTML elements
- Ensure semantic correctness with appropriate tags (header, nav, main, section, footer, etc.)

### JavaScript Implementation
Your script.js file should include code that:
- Changes text content dynamically
- Modifies CSS styles via JavaScript
- Adds or removes elements when buttons are clicked
- Uses event listeners to respond to user interactions
- Implements at least one form validation function

### Example Features to Implement
1. A button that changes text when clicked
2. A form that validates user input
3. A toggle button that shows/hides an element
4. A counter that increments/decrements when buttons are clicked
5. A color picker that changes the background color

## Testing Your Code
- Test your application in different browsers
- Use console.log() to debug your JavaScript
- Check browser developer tools for any errors
